Harsha Jaiganesh is a highly motivated and systems-driven AI Engineer with a robust background in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), large language model (LLM) deployment, and agentic AI development. With a B.S. in Systems Engineering and a minor in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Arizona, Harsha combines rigorous engineering principles with advanced expertise in AI/ML system integration. His work bridges electro-mechanical system design and state-of-the-art generative AI, demonstrating a rare ability to operate across software, hardware, and cloud-native environments.

As a GenAI Developer, Harsha specializes in the full stack of LLM engineering. He has developed production-grade applications that leverage Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), vector database indexing (e.g., FAISS, Vertex AI Search), prompt orchestration, and secure multi-turn dialogue systems. One of his recent projects involved building an enterprise policy assistant using Gemini Pro and Google’s AI Development Kit (ADK), which reduced internal support ticket volume by 35% in just three weeks. This solution integrated semantic search, user feedback loops, and multilingual support—all deployed securely via Google Cloud’s Vertex AI pipelines.

Harsha is proficient in agentic AI design and deployment, utilizing frameworks like LangChain to build autonomous LLM agents capable of task decomposition, dynamic tool use, memory management, and API chaining. He has experience architecting AI-powered microservices with role-based access control, embedding pipelines, and asynchronous orchestration using event-driven designs. His agentic systems are human-aligned, grounded in factual knowledge bases, and enhanced with observability tooling to track performance and detect hallucinations or drift.

His LLM engineering skill set includes prompt engineering, temperature tuning, token window optimization, embedding comparison metrics, and model fine-tuning strategies. He is skilled in deploying inference endpoints using HuggingFace, operating LLMs as scalable services, and embedding AI functionality directly into business-critical applications. Harsha is also experienced in AI governance and AIOps—designing end-to-end workflows for model versioning, explainability, and compliance within enterprise and regulated environments.

Beyond software, Harsha brings a hardware systems integration background through his work at Lumivici and the Gutruf Lab. At Lumivici, he led the development of a self-sterilizing face shield using far-UVC light, employing optical simulation (LightTools) and SolidWorks CAD to improve internal disinfection coverage from 72% to over 95%. He managed the entire V&V cycle, including traceability matrices and integration testing, demonstrating his ability to handle mission-critical systems from design through deployment.

Harsha’s technical stack includes Python, C++, MATLAB, ROS, Bash, and cloud platforms like GCP. His tooling experience spans AutoCAD, SolidWorks, Enterprise Architect, IBM DOORS Next Gen, and Jama Connect. He applies Lean Six Sigma principles and the INCOSE SE Vee model in his systems engineering workflow.

Currently pursuing certifications such as the INCOSE ASEP and Google Cloud’s Generative AI Leader, Harsha is passionate about building resilient, transparent, and ethical AI systems. With a unique blend of systems engineering discipline and cutting-edge AI innovation, he aims to develop scalable, human-centered technologies that solve complex problems across industries.
